Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 3.4

Fix some theme author mess.

== Description ==

Because there are some dumbasses out there who believe that's ok to let the user guess the page IDs, you will find a new page under tools menu that will help you with this. Enjoy! 

== Installation ==

The quickest method for installing this helper is:

1) upload the file (or folder) in your `wp-content/plugins` folder
2) alternatively, you could search for `get-page-ids` in WP repository directly from wp-admin -> plugins -> add new
3) activate
4) check out the newly created tools->Get Page IDs page
